          Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold
          together.
          You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of
          them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports. Do you know what's going on? Maybe
          it's
          another drill. What was that? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is it? I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says I found her, and keeps repeating, She's here. Well,
          who...who has he found? Princess Leia. The princess? She's here? Princess? What's going on? Level five.
          Detention
          block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Oh, no! We've got to do something. What
          are
          you talking about? The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've got to help her. Now, look,
          don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here. But he didn't know she was here. Look,
          will
          you just find a way back into the detention block?
        </p>
        <p>
          He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in
          the
          presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force. The
          Jedi
          are
          extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes.
          Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all
          sections
          on
          alert!
        </p>
        <p>
          The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down
          there, could you give us a hand with this? TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do
          you
          copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your
          blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I
          prefer
          a
          straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to
          interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
